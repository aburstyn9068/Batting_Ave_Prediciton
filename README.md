# Batting_Average_Prediciton
This respository contains a prediction model to calculate the end of season batting averages given a players stats from the begging (March and April) of the season.

My approach to make the preditcion model was to create a linear regession model using a prior year's early season to post season data comparison.

The prediction model uses April 2017 data (there were no games in March 2017, opening day was 4/2/17) and final batting average data from the 2017 season to create a linear regression model. The March/April data from the 2018 season wasl then applied to the model to predict the final batting average for the 2018 season.

The data for this project was obtained from Baseball Savant Statcast Search (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search). Player hitting data was obtained for the 2018 and 2017 seasons.

The first step in the process was to explore the data. Players with less than 30 plate appearances were removed from the set as they can skew the results. Additionally, players with missing stats were eliminated from the data set.

The next step was to check for relationships between the player stats that would be used as input variables for the model. A correlation matrix was plotted and several variables were shown to be highly correlated with one another. Variables that are highly correleated to eachother will cause the model to be less accurate due to the multicollinearity between the variables. ![Correlation Matrix](/images/corr_matrix1.png)
